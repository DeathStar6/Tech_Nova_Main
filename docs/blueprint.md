# **App Name**: Policy Pilot

## Core Features:

- Query Parsing: Parse and structure natural language queries to extract key details like age, procedure, location, and policy duration, by using a Large Language Model as a tool. This enables processing of vague or incomplete queries.
- Intelligent Retrieval: Search and retrieve relevant clauses from documents by semantic understanding rather than keyword matching, even if the query is plain English. Generative AI helps to interpret meaning beyond keywords.
- Automated Decision-Making: Evaluate the retrieved information using a LLM tool to determine the correct decision (approval/rejection, amount), based on the clauses. Generative AI interprets and applies the logic of the policy.
- Structured Output: Generate a structured JSON response containing Decision, Amount (if applicable), and Justification, including mapping each decision to specific clauses. AI helps present data in consistent and interpretable format, increasing speed, transparency and auditability
- Document Upload: Enable document uploads of various file types (PDFs, Word, emails) into the system.
- Decision Presentation: Display a user-friendly interface with the original query, decision, amount, and linked clauses. 

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: HSL values of 220, 85%, and 50% converted to hex: #1AB8FF conveys a feeling of trust and efficiency.
- Background color: HSL values of 220, 20%, and 95% converted to hex: #F0F5FA creates a light, airy, and professional feel.
- Accent color: HSL values of 190, 70%, and 40% converted to hex: #14A39D provides a complementary contrast to highlight key elements and calls to action.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a sans-serif with a modern, objective look.
- Use clear, professional icons representing different document types, decision outcomes, and navigation elements.
- Maintain a clean, structured layout with clear separation of input query, decision output, and document sections.
